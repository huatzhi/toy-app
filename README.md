This is a toy-app practice from the Ruby on Rail Tutorial 5.

Basic:

* Ruby version
ruby 2.3.1p112

* System dependencies
none (?)

* Configuration
none

* Database creation
any will work as long as its useable for ruby on rails and activerecord(?)

* Database initialization
none

* How to run the test suite
I don't know yet(?) Just run the link

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
none

* Deployment instructions
just do it!!
